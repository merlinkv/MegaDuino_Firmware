# MegaDuino Firmware Readme

Original firmware writen by Andrew Beer, Duncan Edwards, Rafael Molina and others.

**MegaDuino Firmware** is an adaptation of the MaxDuino firmware by Rafael Molina and is specially designed for my MegaDuino PCB projects (Mega2560 & dual Mega2560/STM32).

**MegaDuino Firmware** have a different way of displaying information on OLED 128x64 1.3" (8 rows). Also you can use LCD 20x4 screens.

Thanks to the sixth button included in the MegaDuino project (board & components are cased) there is the possibility of deleting files or doing a reset of the board (whithout opening the case).
